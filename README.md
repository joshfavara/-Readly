# Readly.ai

Coming soon on iOS and Android, Readly is a unique mobile application that allows users to set and achieve their reading goals. Upon successful reading, users will share a written response about their learnings within the app. A user-selected AI personality will then evaluate this response in relation to the book they've been reading. Not submitting a response within their goal's time frame will lead to a preset charge, determined by the user themselves.
